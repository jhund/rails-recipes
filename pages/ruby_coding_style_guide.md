Formatting
----------

* Encode in UTF-8.
* End lines Unix-style (LF).
* No line longer than 80 - 100 characters. Makes it possible to read code e.g. in
  version control diffs and ack search results.
* Indent with 2 spaces. No tabs, ever. They make reading diffs hard.
* If you break up long argument lists, hashes, or arrays, keep the elements
  and the closing delimiter on their own lines.

    ```ruby
    do_this({
      :key1 => 1,
      :key2 => 2,
      :key3 => 3,
    })

    dont_do_this({:key1 => 1,
                  :key2 => 2,
                  :key3 => 3})
    ```

* If you break up a chain of method calls, put first call right after receiver
  and put subsequent ones each on its own line.

    ```ruby
    receiver.method1(arg1, arg2)
            .map { |e| e.to_s }
            .sort
            .uniq
    ```

* Avoid indentation other than at the beginning of a line. In other words
  don't vertically align tokens on consecutive lines. It might look pretty
  at first sight, however it creates more work because a change to one line might
  affect all other lines. It makes it harder to spot the actual change in
  version control diffs. Exception: chained method calls (see above).

    ```ruby
    def do_this
      {
        :a => 1,
        :very_long_hash_key => 2,
        :medium => 3
      }
    end

    def dont_do_this
      {
        :a                  => 1,
        :very_long_hash_key => 2,
        :medium             => 3
      }
    end
    ```

* Put spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons, around `{` and before `}`.

    ```ruby
    1 + 3
    array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    hash = { :a => 1, :b => 2, :c => 3 }
    "#{ interpolated_strings }"
    lambda { |args| also_for_blocks }
    ```

* No spaces after `(`, `[` and before `]`, `)`.

    ```ruby
    method(1)
    hash[key]
    array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ```

* Put two spaces before statement modifiers (postfix `if/unless/while/until/rescue`).

    ```ruby
    "true"  if true
    "true"  unless false
    ```

* Indent `when` as deep as `case`.

    ```ruby
    case arg
    when 1
      do_1
    when 2
      do_2
    end
    ```

* Use YARD and its conventions for API documentation.  Don't put an empty line between
  the comment block and the def. [YARD info](http://yardoc.org/).
* Use empty lines to break up a long method into logical paragraphs. Corollary:
  Avoid long methods.
* Use newlines around multi-line blocks (`case`, `if`, `do`, `while`, etc.).
* No trailing whitespace at line endings.


Syntax
------

* Use `def` with parentheses when there are arguments.
* Never use `for`, unless you exactly know why.
* Never use `then`.
* Use `&&/||` for boolean expressions, `and/or` for control flow.  (Rule
  of thumb: If you have to use outer parentheses, you are using the
  wrong operators.)

    ```ruby
    p = Person.find_by_id(id) or raise "Could not find person"
    p = Person.find_by_id(id) || Person.new
    p = Person.find_by_id(id) and p.update_last_seen_at
    ```

* Avoid multiline ternary operators (`? : `), use `if`.
* Use parentheses liberally. Omit them only in the simplest cases.
  They are helpful in breaking long lines and keeping row length under
  100 characters. Makes your ruby look a bit more like C.

    ```ruby
    x = Math.sin(y)
    array.delete(e)
    ```

* Prefer `{...}` over `do...end`. Multiline `{...}` is fine: having different
  statement endings (`}` for blocks, `end` for if/while/...) makes it easier to
  see what ends where. But use `do...end` for "control flow" and
  "method definitions" (e.g. in Rakefiles and certain DSLs.). Avoid `do...end`
  when chaining.
* Avoid `return` where not required.
* Using the return value of `=` is okay. Put parentheses around it to indicate
  that this is intentional:

    ```ruby
    if (v = array.grep(/foo/))
      # do something with v
    end
    ```

* When comparing two values, put the constant first. This will raise an error
  if you use `=` where you should have used `==`: `if "start" == state`.
* Use `||=` freely.
* Use `w%[...]` notation for arrays that contain single word strings:
  `%w[project todo collaborator].each { |e| puts e }`.
* Use `\A and \z` to set boundaries on regular expressions, don't use `^ and $`.
  `\A` and `\z` match to the beginning/end of the string. `^` and `$` match to
  the beginning/end of a line.
* Append a comma after the last array entry or hash key. Ruby can parse this
  syntax, and it helps you avoid syntax errors when you resort the elements:

    ```ruby
    a = [
      :item1,
      :item2,
      :item3,
    ]
    ```

Naming
------

* Use `snake_case` for methods.
* Use `CamelCase` for classes and modules. (Keep acronyms like HTTP, RFC, XML uppercase.)
* Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for other constants.
* The length of an identifier determines its scope.  Use one-letter variables for short
  block/method parameters, according to this scheme:
    * e: elements of an Enumerable: ary.each { |e| puts e }
    * ex: rescued exceptions: rescue
    * f: files and file names
    * i,j: indexes
    * k: the key part of a hash entry
    * r: a return value
    * s: a string
    * v: any value
    * v: the value part of a hash entry

* Use `_` for unused variables: `def mock(_)`.
* When using inject with short blocks, name the arguments `|m, e|` (mnemonic: memo, each).
* When defining binary operators, name the argument "other": `def +(other)`.
* Prefer `map` over collect, `find` over `detect`, `find_all` over `select`.
* Use the following format for boolean getters: `has_permission?`, `is_yellow?`
* Start expensive method names with "compute_", memoize result in a wrapping
  method where appropriate.
* When iterating over an enumerable in a multi-line block, name the block param
  the singular of the collection.

Comments
--------

* Comments longer than a word are capitalized and use punctuation.
* Avoid superfluous comments that don't add any information to what the code
  already provides.

General
-------

* Code in a functional way, avoid mutation when it makes sense. Mark methods
  with side effects with a `!` at the end of the method name.
* Do not mess around in core classes when writing libraries.
* [Do not program defensively.](http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml#HDR11)
  <blockquote>
    One should not test input data to functions for correctness. Most of the code in the system
    should be written with the assumption that the input data to the function in question is
    correct. Only check data when it "enters" the system for the first time.
  </blockquote>

Ruby idiosyncrasies
--------

* When testing if a DateTime falls into a range, use `cover?` instead of `include?`.
  [This article](http://pivotallabs.com/reading-the-ruby-source/) explains why.
  This is the fix if you experience `warning: Time#succ is obsolete`.

The rest
--------

* Avoid long methods.
* Avoid long parameter lists.
* Avoid message chaining (`task.project.user`), use #delegate instead (`task.user`)
* Use `def self.method` to define singleton/class methods. It communicates much more clearly whatâ€™s a class method. Unless you need to mark a class method as private or protected. Then you have to use the `class << self` (singleton_class) form.
* Avoid `alias` when `alias_method` will do.
* Write for Ruby 2.0. It's time leave 1.8 and 1.9 behind.
* Don't optimize prematurely. Optimize when you have no other choice.
* Don't over-engineer (unnecessary abstractions)
* Don't under-engineer (copy and paste code)
* Avoid needless metaprogramming. Prefer explicity over magic. Your future self
  and other readers of your code with thank you for it.
* Be consistent.
* Don't generalize prematurely. Build 2 specific solutions before you build a
  general solution.
* Design breadth first. Don't jump on the first implementation idea that pops up in your mind.
  Make an effort to come up with 2 alternative approaches. This doesn't have to take long.
